# Unreleased

## Added

- `lambdaisland.glogi.console` provides an alternative to `goog.debug.Console`,
  with the main benefit that it will log full data structures, thus playing
  nicely with cljs-devtools

## Changed

- The default formatter is now `identity` instead of `pr-str`. This way we
  preserve full data structures until the last minute. Note that goog.debug.Logger
  will stringify the message, unless care is taken for it not to.
